The "Carrot Quiver" ( https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1040665326410530836 ) requires (1) 608 2RS bearing per wheel, which supports 3 filament slots.  I am using (2) 5mm heat set inserts and (2) M5 x 16mm long button head screws to secure the plastic axle that runs through the bearings.  There are (6) PC4-M10 bowden fittings per x3 Quiver and I mount the quiver to the 2020 extrusions using (2) total M5 roll-in t-nuts and (2) M5 x 16mm long socket head screws, (1) each for the top and bottom mounts.

I will caution that this design has tight tolerances around the wheel so that filament can not get lodged in any gaps or neighboring slots.  This means the axle needs to be aligned well and any rubbing between the wheel and the upper quiver parts may need to be filed, sanded, exacto knifed away.  I also used a M10 tap to clean out the M10x1 printed threads for the bowden fittings and M3 and M4 drill bits to clean up the bowden tube holes.  ~41mm of 4mm bowden tubing should insert through the fitting and down to where it seats in the block.  If it does not go in ~41mm then the hole needs to be cleaned out with a 4mm drill bit.  Do not clean out the hole any deeper than 41mm as there is a step down to 3.2mm at this point to serve as a stop for the tubing.  You can run a 3mm drill bit through the entire hole if necessary to ensure an open path for filament.  So this design does require a little bit of post processing and tuning but once right it works well and is easy to thread and gain access to the filament.

For those who may not have M5 heatsets, I have and a version of the Wheel Block and Axle for M3 heatsets and screws.

It is important that the heatsets get installed straight.  One trick is to have a flat metal object ready and as your are pressing in the heatset stop while it is still slightly above the surface of the wheel block and then finish seating it with the the flat metal object pressing flat against the face of the Wheel Block part.  Some people use black brass wax sealing stamps for this purpose.  I am using a small cylindrical calibration weight.
